# Unnamed Appalachian Roguelike

"Unnamed Appalachian Roguelike" is a learning project for me.

## What Am I Learning?

* Git and Github
* Autoconf
* C 2018
* LaTeX
* Cross Platform Development
* Other Powerful Words!

I'm using Raspbian Buster to develop on, and will use Raspbian Buster, MSYS2, and Debian on WSL to see if it builds.  

## Why Appalachian?

Seems underutilized for video games, at least for Fantasy style CRPGs.
